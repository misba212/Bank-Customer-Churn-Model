# Bank-Customer-Churn-Model
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn for a bank, helping identify at-risk customers. By analyzing factors like account activity, tenure, and demographics, we build a model to classify customers as likely to "churn" or "retain." This allows for targeted retention strategies, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn.
